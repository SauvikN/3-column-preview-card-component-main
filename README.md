## My process

I first added the HTML tags to give structure to the website and so that i can properly use the CSS box model. Then I added CSS styles using a mobile-first design and then made it desktop friendly using media queries.

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

```css
.container {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    border: none;
    border-radius: 10px;
    align-items: center;
    overflow: hidden;
    max-width: 1000px;
}
```

### Useful resources

-   [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-image) - Helped me with the background property in CSS.
